Crystallography, Saint Petersburg State University (SPbU), Russia. My major is Structural Mineralogy and Material Science. I obtained bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree in Geophysics and Geochemistry also from SPbU. I can be reached via ruiqi_chen at 163 dot com.\nCurrently I research on metamict minerals and their transformations under high-temparature conditions. During undergraduate, I study the synthesis, properties, and crystal-chemical features of some analogues of anhydrous sulfate minerals. Both are supported by Russian Science Foundation. I am fortunate to be advised by professor Oleg Siidra.\nI am actively looking for both research and non-research jobs in Singapore, Europe, or China. You can find my cv here (Chinese version here).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/ruiqi-chen/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/ruiqi-chen/","section":"authors","summary":"My name is Ruiqi Chen (陈睿琪 in Chinese and Рики in Russian).
